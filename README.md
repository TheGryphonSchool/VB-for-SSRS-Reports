# VB-for-SSRS-Reports
This project is primarily a library of pure functions, written in Visual Basic,
that you can use and re-use as custom code in SSRS reports.

It also contains a highly configurable tool for bundling modules of custom code
into a format that you can copy and paste directly into your reports.
